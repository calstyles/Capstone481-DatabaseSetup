# Capstone-Project-Files
For this project, I am focusing on building the database structure that we will be using for Critical Microgrid Services. 
I expect that by the end of this project the database will have the following battery information inside of it:
  
  -voltage
  
  -current
  
  -resistance
  
  -watt hours
  
  -state of charge
  
  -depth of discharge
  
  -battery health
  
I will be utilizing a node-red structure to insert and update the values within the database table.

I will also be focused on gathering the GPS data that will be keeping track of where the cart is at all times. 
The following information will be provided in the database:
  
  -geo-location
  
  -longitude
  
  -latitude
