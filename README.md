# MVP-Capstone480
For this project, I am focusing on building the database structure that we will be using for a set of electric vehicles for Critical Microgrid Services. 
This project will be dealing with data analysis and managing how things are getting stored inside of the database. The database has the following battery information inside of it:
  
  -voltage
  
  -current
  
  -resistance
  
  -watt hours
  
  -state of charge
  
  -depth of discharge
  
  -battery health

I will also be focused on gathering the GPS data that will be keeping track of where the cart is at all times. 
The following information from the GPS will be provided in the database:
  
  -geo-location
  
  -longitude
  
  -latitude

I will be utilizing a node-red structure along with the SQL code that I have developed to insert and update the values within the database table. Once we have these values, I'll be analyzing the data and checking how it is changing over time through graphs.
