# MVP-Capstone480
For this project, I am focusing on building the database structure that we will be using for a set of electric vehicles for Critical Microgrid Services. 
This project will be dealing with data analysis and managing how things are getting stored inside of the database. The database currently has the following battery information inside of it:
  
  -voltage
  
  -current
  
  -resistance
  
  -watt hours
  
  -state of charge
  
  -depth of discharge
  
  -battery health

I will also be focused on gathering the GPS data that will be keeping track of where the cart is at all times. 
The following information from the GPS will be provided in the database:
  
  -longitude
  
  -latitude

I will be utilizing a node-red structure that will put out the data along with the SQL code that I have developed to insert and update the values within the database table. What we currently have in the database is values of the battery that we have been testing over the past few months. We will be making this project scalable for all of the electric vehicles that are a part of the system and modifying the database to accompany these values. Once we have the values of all the carts, I'll be analyzing the data and checking how it is changing over time through graphs.

Note: The measurements listed may expand to encompass more as we continue with the project.
